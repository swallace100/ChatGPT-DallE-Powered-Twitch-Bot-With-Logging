# Twitch Bot - Responses and Logs

## Description
  
- There weren't many tutorials on how to make TWitch bots using the site's APIs, so I made one using the API documentation.
- This bot can response automatically with random phrases is someone in chat enters a designated word.
- All chat messages are saved to a designated folder.
  
- There are a lot of powerful moderator bots out there, but this one is for record keeping and chat interaction. 


## Installation

This can be run on any development platform with Python support, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

- Individual user keys provided by Twitch are required to access the API. Please follow the steps here to acquire yours https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/
  
- A file path must also be provided in the designated line in the code for the chat logs to be saved.
  
- There are pre-set keywords that the bot will respond to, but those can be edited, as well.

## Built With
